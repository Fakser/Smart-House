```python
@array_function_dispatch(_atleast_1d_dispatcher)
def atleast_1d(*arys):
```

Convert inputs to arrays with at least one dimension.

Scalar inputs are converted to 1-dimensional arrays, whilst
higher-dimensional inputs are preserved.

Parameters
----------
arys1, arys2, ... : array_like
    One or more input arrays.

Returns
-------
ret : ndarray
    An array, or list of arrays, each with ``a.ndim >= 1``.
    Copies are made only if necessary.

See Also
--------
atleast_2d, atleast_3d

Examples
--------

```python
>>> np.atleast_1d(1.0)
array([1.])
```

```python
>>> x = np.arange(9.0).reshape(3,3)
>>> np.atleast_1d(x)
array([[0., 1., 2.],
       [3., 4., 5.],
       [6., 7., 8.]])
>>> np.atleast_1d(x) is x
True
```

```python
>>> np.atleast_1d(1, [3, 4])
[array([1]), array([3, 4])]

## atleast_2d

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\numpy\core\shape_base.py#L82)

```python
@array_function_dispatch(_atleast_2d_dispatcher)
def atleast_2d(*arys):
```

View inputs as arrays with at least two dimensions.

Parameters
----------
arys1, arys2, ... : array_like
    One or more array-like sequences.  Non-array inputs are converted
    to arrays.  Arrays that already have two or more dimensions are
    preserved.

Returns
-------
res, res2, ... : ndarray
    An array, or list of arrays, each with ``a.ndim >= 2``.
    Copies are avoided where possible, and views with two or more
    dimensions are returned.

See Also
--------
atleast_1d, atleast_3d

Examples
--------

```python
>>> np.atleast_2d(3.0)
array([[3.]])
```

```python
>>> x = np.arange(3.0)
>>> np.atleast_2d(x)
array([[0., 1., 2.]])
>>> np.atleast_2d(x).base is x
True
```

```python
>>> np.atleast_2d(1, [1, 2], [[1, 2]])
[array([[1]]), array([[1, 2]]), array([[1, 2]])]

## atleast_3d

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\numpy\core\shape_base.py#L140)

```python
@array_function_dispatch(_atleast_3d_dispatcher)
def atleast_3d(*arys):
```

View inputs as arrays with at least three dimensions.

Parameters
----------
arys1, arys2, ... : array_like
    One or more array-like sequences.  Non-array inputs are converted to
    arrays.  Arrays that already have three or more dimensions are
    preserved.

Returns
-------
res1, res2, ... : ndarray
    An array, or list of arrays, each with ``a.ndim >= 3``.  Copies are
    avoided where possible, and views with three or more dimensions are
    returned.  For example, a 1-D array of shape ``(N,)`` becomes a view
    of shape ``(1, N, 1)``, and a 2-D array of shape ``(M, N)`` becomes a
    view of shape ``(M, N, 1)``.

## block

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\numpy\core\shape_base.py#L680)

```python
@array_function_dispatch(_block_dispatcher)
def block(arrays):
```

Assemble an nd-array from nested lists of blocks.

Blocks in the innermost lists are concatenated (see `concatenate`) along
the last dimension (-1), then these are concatenated along the
second-last dimension (-2), and so on until the outermost list is reached.

Blocks can be of any dimension, but will not be broadcasted using the normal
rules. Instead, leading axes of size 1 are inserted, to make ``block.ndim``
the same for all blocks. This is primarily useful for working with scalars,
and means that code like ``np.block([v, 1])`` is valid, where
``v.ndim == 1``.

When the nested list is two levels deep, this allows block matrices to be
constructed from their components.

#### Notes

Added in version 1.13.0

Parameters
----------
arrays : nested list of array_like or scalars (but not tuples)
    If passed a single ndarray or scalar (a nested list of depth 0), this
    is returned unmodified (and not copied).

Elements shapes must match along the appropriate axes (without
broadcasting), but leading 1s will be prepended to the shape as
necessary to make the dimensions match.

Returns
-------
block_array : ndarray
    The array assembled from the given blocks.

The dimensionality of the output is equal to the greatest of:
* the dimensionality of all the inputs
* the depth to which the input list is nested

Raises
------
ValueError
    * If list depths are mismatched - for instance, ``[[a, b], c]`` is
      illegal, and should be spelt ``[[a, b], [c]]``
    * If lists are empty - for instance, ``[[a, b], []]``

See Also
--------
concatenate : Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.
stack : Join a sequence of arrays along a new axis.
vstack : Stack arrays in sequence vertically (row wise).
hstack : Stack arrays in sequence horizontally (column wise).
dstack : Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third axis).
column_stack : Stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array.
vsplit : Split an array into multiple sub-arrays vertically (row-wise).

Notes
-----

When called with only scalars, ``np.block`` is equivalent to an ndarray
call. So ``np.block([[1, 2], [3, 4]])`` is equivalent to
``np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])``.

This function does not enforce that the blocks lie on a fixed grid.
``np.block([[a, b], [c, d]])`` is not restricted to arrays of the form

```python
AAAbb
AAAbb
cccDD
```

But is also allowed to produce, for some ``a, b, c, d``

```python
AAAbb
AAAbb
cDDDD
```

Since concatenation happens along the last axis first, [block](#block) is _not_
capable of producing the following directly

```python
AAAbb
cccbb
cccDD
```

Matlab's "square bracket stacking", ``[A, B, ...; p, q, ...]``, is
equivalent to ``np.block([[A, B, ...], [p, q, ...]])``.

Examples
--------
The most common use of this function is to build a block matrix

```python
>>> A = np.eye(2) * 2
>>> B = np.eye(3) * 3
>>> np.block([
...     [A,               np.zeros((2, 3))],
...     [np.ones((3, 2)), B               ]
... ])
array([[2., 0., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 2., 0., 0., 0.],
       [1., 1., 3., 0., 0.],
       [1., 1., 0., 3., 0.],
       [1., 1., 0., 0., 3.]])
```

With a list of depth 1, [block](#block) can be used as [hstack](#hstack)

```python
>>> np.block([1, 2, 3])              # hstack([1, 2, 3])
array([1, 2, 3])
```

```python
>>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
>>> b = np.array([2, 3, 4])
>>> np.block([a, b, 10])             # hstack([a, b, 10])
array([ 1,  2,  3,  2,  3,  4, 10])
```

```python
>>> A = np.ones((2, 2), int)
>>> B = 2 * A
>>> np.block([A, B])                 # hstack([A, B])
array([[1, 1, 2, 2],
       [1, 1, 2, 2]])
```

With a list of depth 2, [block](#block) can be used in place of [vstack](#vstack):

```python
>>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
>>> b = np.array([2, 3, 4])
>>> np.block([[a], [b]])             # vstack([a, b])
array([[1, 2, 3],
       [2, 3, 4]])
```

```python
>>> A = np.ones((2, 2), int)
>>> B = 2 * A
>>> np.block([[A], [B]])             # vstack([A, B])
array([[1, 1],
       [1, 1],
       [2, 2],
       [2, 2]])
```

It can also be used in places of [atleast_1d](#atleast_1d) and [atleast_2d](#atleast_2d)

```python
>>> a = np.array(0)
>>> b = np.array([1])
>>> np.block([a])                    # atleast_1d(a)
array([0])
>>> np.block([b])                    # atleast_1d(b)
array([1])
```

```python
>>> np.block([[a]])                  # atleast_2d(a)
array([[0]])
>>> np.block([[b]])                  # atleast_2d(b)
array([[1]])

## hstack

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\numpy\core\shape_base.py#L286)

```python
@array_function_dispatch(_vhstack_dispatcher)
def hstack(tup):
```

Stack arrays in sequence horizontally (column wise).

This is equivalent to concatenation along the second axis, except for 1-D
arrays where it concatenates along the first axis. Rebuilds arrays divided
by `hsplit`.

This function makes most sense for arrays with up to 3 dimensions. For
instance, for pixel-data with a height (first axis), width (second axis),
and r/g/b channels (third axis). The functions `concatenate`, [stack](#stack) and
[block](#block) provide more general stacking and concatenation operations.

Parameters
----------
tup : sequence of ndarrays
    The arrays must have the same shape along all but the second axis,
    except 1-D arrays which can be any length.

Returns
-------
stacked : ndarray
    The array formed by stacking the given arrays.

See Also
--------
concatenate : Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.
stack : Join a sequence of arrays along a new axis.
block : Assemble an nd-array from nested lists of blocks.
vstack : Stack arrays in sequence vertically (row wise).
dstack : Stack arrays in sequence depth wise (along third axis).
column_stack : Stack 1-D arrays as columns into a 2-D array.
hsplit : Split an array into multiple sub-arrays horizontally (column-wise).

Examples
--------

```python
>>> a = np.array((1,2,3))
>>> b = np.array((2,3,4))
>>> np.hstack((a,b))
array([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4])
>>> a = np.array([[1],[2],[3]])
>>> b = np.array([[2],[3],[4]])
>>> np.hstack((a,b))
array([[1, 2],
       [2, 3],
       [3, 4]])

## stack

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\numpy\core\shape_base.py#L358)

```python
@array_function_dispatch(_stack_dispatcher)
def stack(arrays, axis=0, out=None):
```

Join a sequence of arrays along a new axis.

The ``axis`` parameter specifies the index of the new axis in the
dimensions of the result. For example, if ``axis=0`` it will be the first
dimension and if ``axis=-1`` it will be the last dimension.

#### Notes

Added in version 1.10.0

Parameters
----------
arrays : sequence of array_like
    Each array must have the same shape.

axis : int, optional
    The axis in the result array along which the input arrays are stacked.

out : ndarray, optional
    If provided, the destination to place the result. The shape must be
    correct, matching that of what stack would have returned if no
    out argument were specified.

Returns
-------
stacked : ndarray
    The stacked array has one more dimension than the input arrays.

See Also
--------
concatenate : Join a sequence of arrays along an existing axis.
block : Assemble an nd-array from nested lists of blocks.
split : Split array into a list of multiple sub-arrays of equal size.

Examples
--------

```python
>>> arrays = [np.random.randn(3, 4) for _ in range(10)]
>>> np.stack(arrays, axis=0).shape
(10, 3, 4)
```

```python
>>> np.stack(arrays, axis=1).shape
(3, 10, 4)
```

```python
>>> np.stack(arrays, axis=2).shape
(3, 4, 10)
```

```python
>>> a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
>>> b = np.array([2, 3, 4])
>>> np.stack((a, b))
array([[1, 2, 3],
       [2, 3, 4]])
```

```python
>>> np.stack((a, b), axis=-1)
array([[1, 2],
       [2, 3],
       [3, 4]])

## vstack

```python
@array_function_dispatch(_vhstack_dispatcher)
def vstack(tup):
```

This is equivalent to concatenation along the first axis after 1-D arrays
of shape `(N,)` have been reshaped to `(1,N)`. Rebuilds arrays divided by
`vsplit`.

This function makes most sense for arrays with up to 3 dimensions. For
instance, for pixel-data with a height (first axis), width (second axis),
and r/g/b channels (third axis). The functions `concatenate`, [stack](#stack) and
[block](#block) provide more general stacking and concatenation operations.

Parameters
----------
tup : sequence of ndarrays
    The arrays must have the same shape along all but the first axis.
    1-D arrays must have the same length.

Returns
-------
stacked : ndarray
    The array formed by stacking the given arrays, will be at least 2-D.

       [2, 3, 4]])
```

```python
>>> a = np.array([[1], [2], [3]])
>>> b = np.array([[2], [3], [4]])
>>> np.vstack((a,b))
array([[1],
       [2],
       [3],
