#### Attributes

- `visible_prompt_func` - The prompt functions to use.  The doc tools currently override these
  functions to customize how they work.: `raw_input`

## clear

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\click\termui.py#L415)

```python
def clear():
```

Clears the terminal screen.  This will have the effect of clearing
the whole visible space of the terminal and moving the cursor to the
top left.  This does not do anything if not connected to a terminal.

#### Notes

Added in version 2.0

## confirm

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\click\termui.py#L172)

```python
def confirm(
    text,
    default=False,
    abort=False,
    prompt_suffix=': ',
    show_default=True,
    err=False,
):
```

Prompts for confirmation (yes/no question).

If the user aborts the input by sending a interrupt signal this
function will catch it and raise a exception `Abort` exception.

#### Notes

Added in version 4.0
   Added the `err` parameter.

#### Arguments

- `text` - the question to ask.
- `default` - the default for the prompt.
- `abort` - if this is set to `True` a negative answer aborts the
              exception by raising exception `Abort`.
- `prompt_suffix` - a suffix that should be added to the prompt.
- `show_default` - shows or hides the default value in the prompt.
- `err` - if set to true the file defaults to ``stderr`` instead of
            ``stdout``, the same as with echo.

## echo_via_pager

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\click\termui.py#L265)

```python
def echo_via_pager(text_or_generator, color=None):
```

This function takes a text and shows it via an environment specific
pager on stdout.

#### Notes

Changed in version 3.0
   Added the `color` flag.

#### Arguments

- `text_or_generator` - the text to page, or alternatively, a
                          generator emitting the text to page.
- `color` - controls if the pager supports ANSI colors or not.  The
              default is autodetection.

## edit

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\click\termui.py#L551)

```python
def edit(
    text=None,
    editor=None,
    env=None,
    require_save=True,
    extension='.txt',
    filename=None,
):
```

Edits the given text in the defined editor.  If an editor is given
(should be the full path to the executable but the regular operating
system search path is used for finding the executable) it overrides
the detected editor.  Optionally, some environment variables can be
used.  If the editor is closed without changes, `None` is returned.  In
case a file is edited directly the return value is always `None` and
`require_save` and `extension` are ignored.

If the editor cannot be opened a exception `UsageError` is raised.

Note for Windows: to simplify cross-platform usage, the newlines are
automatically converted from POSIX to Windows and vice versa.  As such,
the message here will have ``\n`` as newline markers.

#### Arguments

- `text` - the text to edit.
- `editor` - optionally the editor to use.  Defaults to automatic
               detection.
- `env` - environment variables to forward to the editor.
- `require_save` - if this is true, then not saving in the editor
                     will make the return value become `None`.
- `extension` - the extension to tell the editor about.  This defaults
                  to `.txt` but changing this might change syntax
                  highlighting.
- `filename` - if provided it will edit this file instead of the
                 provided text contents.  It will not use a temporary
                 file as an indirection in that case.

## get_terminal_size

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\click\termui.py#L218)

```python
def get_terminal_size():
```

Returns the current size of the terminal as tuple in the form
``(width, height)`` in columns and rows.

## getchar

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\click\termui.py#L623)

```python
def getchar(echo=False):
```

Fetches a single character from the terminal and returns it.  This
will always return a unicode character and under certain rare
circumstances this might return more than one character.  The
situations which more than one character is returned is when for
whatever reason multiple characters end up in the terminal buffer or
standard input was not actually a terminal.

Note that this will always read from the terminal, even if something
is piped into the standard input.

Note for Windows: in rare cases when typing non-ASCII characters, this
function might wait for a second character and then return both at once.
This is because certain Unicode characters look like special-key markers.

#### Notes

Added in version 2.0

#### Arguments

- `echo` - if set to `True`, the character read will also show up on
             the terminal.  The default is to not show it.

## hidden_prompt_func

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\click\termui.py#L51)

```python
def hidden_prompt_func(prompt):
```

## launch

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\click\termui.py#L591)

```python
def launch(url, wait=False, locate=False):
```

This function launches the given URL (or filename) in the default
viewer application for this file type.  If this is an executable, it
might launch the executable in a new session.  The return value is
the exit code of the launched application.  Usually, ``0`` indicates
success.

Examples

```python
click.launch('https://click.palletsprojects.com/')
click.launch('/my/downloaded/file', locate=True)
```

#### Notes

Added in version 2.0

#### Arguments

- `url` - URL or filename of the thing to launch.
- `wait` - waits for the program to stop.
- `locate` - if this is set to `True` then instead of launching the
               application associated with the URL it will attempt to
               launch a file manager with the file located.  This
               might have weird effects if the URL does not point to
               the filesystem.

## pause

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\click\termui.py#L655)

```python
def pause(info='Press any key to continue ...', err=False):
```

This command stops execution and waits for the user to press any
key to continue.  This is similar to the Windows batch "pause"
command.  If the program is not run through a terminal, this command
will instead do nothing.

#### Notes

Added in version 2.0

Added in version 4.0
   Added the `err` parameter.

#### Arguments

- `info` - the info string to print before pausing.
- `err` - if set to message goes to ``stderr`` instead of
            ``stdout``, the same as with echo.

## progressbar

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\click\termui.py#L294)

```python
def progressbar(
    iterable=None,
    length=None,
    label=None,
    show_eta=True,
    show_percent=None,
    show_pos=False,
    item_show_func=None,
    fill_char='#',
    empty_char='-',
    bar_template='%(label)s  [%(bar)s]  %(info)s',
    info_sep='  ',
    width=36,
    file=None,
    color=None,
):
```

This function creates an iterable context manager that can be used
to iterate over something while showing a progress bar.  It will
either iterate over the `iterable` or `length` items (that are counted
up).  While iteration happens, this function will print a rendered
progress bar to the given `file` (defaults to stdout) and will attempt
to calculate remaining time and more.  By default, this progress bar
will not be rendered if the file is not a terminal.

The context manager creates the progress bar.  When the context
manager is entered the progress bar is already created.  With every
iteration over the progress bar, the iterable passed to the bar is
advanced and the bar is updated.  When the context manager exits,
a newline is printed and the progress bar is finalized on screen.

Note: The progress bar is currently designed for use cases where the
total progress can be expected to take at least several seconds.
Because of this, the ProgressBar class object won't display
progress that is considered too fast, and progress where the time
between steps is less than a second.

No printing must happen or the progress bar will be unintentionally
destroyed.

Example usage

```python
with progressbar(items) as bar:
    for item in bar:
        do_something_with(item)
```

Alternatively, if no iterable is specified, one can manually update the
progress bar through the `update()` method instead of directly
iterating over the progress bar.  The update method accepts the number
of steps to increment the bar with

```python
with progressbar(length=chunks.total_bytes) as bar:
    for chunk in chunks:
        process_chunk(chunk)
        bar.update(chunks.bytes)
```

#### Notes

Added in version 2.0

Added in version 4.0
   Added the `color` parameter.  Added a `update` method to the
   progressbar object.

#### Arguments

- `iterable` - an iterable to iterate over.  If not provided the length
                 is required.
- `length` - the number of items to iterate over.  By default the
               progressbar will attempt to ask the iterator about its
               length, which might or might not work.  If an iterable is
               also provided this parameter can be used to override the
               length.  If an iterable is not provided the progress bar
               will iterate over a range of that length.
- `label` - the label to show next to the progress bar.
- `show_eta` - enables or disables the estimated time display.  This is
                 automatically disabled if the length cannot be
                 determined.
- `show_percent` - enables or disables the percentage display.  The
                     default is `True` if the iterable has a length or
                     `False` if not.
- `show_pos` - enables or disables the absolute position display.  The
                 default is `False`.
- `item_show_func` - a function called with the current item which
                       can return a string to show the current item
                       next to the progress bar.  Note that the current
                       item can be `None`!
- `fill_char` - the character to use to show the filled part of the
                  progress bar.
- `empty_char` - the character to use to show the non-filled part of
                   the progress bar.
- `bar_template` - the format string to use as template for the bar.
                     The parameters in it are ``label`` for the label,
                     ``bar`` for the progress bar and ``info`` for the
                     info section.
- `info_sep` - the separator between multiple info items (eta etc.)
- `width` - the width of the progress bar in characters, 0 means full
              terminal width
- `file` - the file to write to.  If this is not a terminal then
             only the label is printed.
- `color` - controls if the terminal supports ANSI colors or not.  The
              default is autodetection.  This is only needed if ANSI
              codes are included anywhere in the progress bar output
              which is not the case by default.

## prompt

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\click\termui.py#L75)

```python
def prompt(
    text,
    default=None,
    hide_input=False,
    confirmation_prompt=False,
    type=None,
    value_proc=None,
    prompt_suffix=': ',
    show_default=True,
    err=False,
    show_choices=True,
):
```

Prompts a user for input.  This is a convenience function that can
be used to prompt a user for input later.

If the user aborts the input by sending a interrupt signal, this
function will catch it and raise a exception `Abort` exception.

#### Notes

Added in version 7.0
   Added the show_choices parameter.

Added in version 6.0
   Added unicode support for cmd.exe on Windows.

Added in version 4.0
   Added the `err` parameter.

#### Arguments

- `text` - the text to show for the prompt.
- `default` - the default value to use if no input happens.  If this
                is not given it will prompt until it's aborted.
- `hide_input` - if this is set to true then the input value will
                   be hidden.
- `confirmation_prompt` - asks for confirmation for the value.
- `type` - the type to use to check the value against.
- `value_proc` - if this parameter is provided it's a function that
                   is invoked instead of the type conversion to
                   convert a value.
- `prompt_suffix` - a suffix that should be added to the prompt.
- `show_default` - shows or hides the default value in the prompt.
- `err` - if set to true the file defaults to ``stderr`` instead of
            ``stdout``, the same as with echo.
- `show_choices` - Show or hide choices if the passed type is a Choice.
                     For example if type is a Choice of either day or week,
                     show_choices is true and text is "Group by" then the
                     prompt will be "Group by (day, week): ".

## raw_terminal

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\click\termui.py#L649)

```python
def raw_terminal():
```

## secho

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\click\termui.py#L534)

```python
def secho(message=None, file=None, nl=True, err=False, color=None, **styles):
```

This function combines :func:`echo` and :func:[style](#style) into one
call.  As such the following two calls are the same

```python
click.secho('Hello World!', fg='green')
click.echo(click.style('Hello World!', fg='green'))
```

All keyword arguments are forwarded to the underlying functions
depending on which one they go with.

#### Notes

Added in version 2.0

## style

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\click\termui.py#L433)

```python
def style(
    text,
    fg=None,
    bg=None,
    bold=None,
    dim=None,
    underline=None,
    blink=None,
    reverse=None,
    reset=True,
):
```

Styles a text with ANSI styles and returns the new string.  By
default the styling is self contained which means that at the end
of the string a reset code is issued.  This can be prevented by
passing ``reset=False``.

Examples

```python
click.echo(click.style('Hello World!', fg='green'))
click.echo(click.style('ATTENTION!', blink=True))
click.echo(click.style('Some things', reverse=True, fg='cyan'))
```

Supported color names:

* ``black`` (might be a gray)
* ``red``
* ``green``
* ``yellow`` (might be an orange)
* ``blue``
* ``magenta``
* ``cyan``
* ``white`` (might be light gray)
* ``bright_black``
* ``bright_red``
* ``bright_green``
* ``bright_yellow``
* ``bright_blue``
* ``bright_magenta``
* ``bright_cyan``
* ``bright_white``
* ``reset`` (reset the color code only)

#### Notes

Added in version 2.0

Added in version 7.0
   Added support for bright colors.

#### Arguments

- `text` - the string to style with ansi codes.
- `fg` - if provided this will become the foreground color.
- `bg` - if provided this will become the background color.
- `bold` - if provided this will enable or disable bold mode.
- `dim` - if provided this will enable or disable dim mode.  This is
            badly supported.
- `underline` - if provided this will enable or disable underline.
- `blink` - if provided this will enable or disable blinking.
- `reverse` - if provided this will enable or disable inverse
                rendering (foreground becomes background and the
                other way round).
- `reset` - by default a reset-all code is added at the end of the
              string which means that styles do not carry over.  This
              can be disabled to compose styles.

## unstyle

[[find in source code]](..\..\..\..\..\env\Lib\site-packages\click\termui.py#L522)

```python
def unstyle(text):
```

Removes ANSI styling information from a string.  Usually it's not
necessary to use this function as Click's echo function will
automatically remove styling if necessary.

#### Notes

Added in version 2.0

#### Arguments

- `text` - the text to remove style information from.
